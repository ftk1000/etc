## How to compute TBS

[https://ltebasics.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/transport-block-size-determination-in-lte/](https://ltebasics.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/transport-block-size-determination-in-lte/)

The MAC has to first decide on the modulation scheme that can be scheduled to the user and then check the physical resource grid for availability of the resource blocks. From this step the MAC can decide upon the modulation and coding scheme index (I_MCS)  and then decide upon the number of resource blocks (N_PRB), that can be allocated to the user. After this step the transport block size index (I_TBS) is derived from the look up table as specified in the LTE phy specification 36.213 sec 7.1.7.1 for downlink and sec 8.6.1 for uplink.
